# Bright's Bootcamp 

Instead of copying and pasting solutions on discord we are going to get you working with Git. 
Git is the defacto version control choice for any developer or budding developer today.

# Running tests

we have the same test runner as the alchemy team. Mocha with the same assertion library chai. 

You'll need to be in this repository's root folder. ```/bootcamp``` on your machine use the ```test``` command inside of the pacakage.json folder to run a specific test file. You'll just need to the give the ```test``` command the relative path to the file. 

```
    pnpm run test ./Errors/catch-errors/test.js
```
